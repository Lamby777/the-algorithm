Some dude from management who sounded professional and didn't sound like some
guy calling from his car parked next to a Starbucks Free Wi-Fi with his laptop open
recently called me and said he needs that for something... I posted it here in

of at least 150% more propaganda and 20% more bots by the end of Spring 2023. Got it? Good.
